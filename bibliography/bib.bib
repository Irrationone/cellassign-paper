abstract = {PURPOSE Despite the generally favorable clinical course in follicular lymphoma (FL), a minority of patients have a poor prognosis-with death within 3 years of diagnosis-most often due to transformation to aggressive disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this study, we analyzed the potential of predicting early transformation on the basis of gene expression and immunologic parameters in FL biopsy samples taken at diagnosis. RESULTS At the gene-expression level, FL is a highly uniform disease at the time of diagnosis, precluding the detection of sufficiently validated prognostic gene-expression profiles suitable for a clinical setting. Combinations of differentially expressed genes indicate that immunologic mechanisms play a differential role in the risk of early transformation. Using immunohistochemistry for specific cell populations, the spatial distribution to neoplastic follicles and the activation of CD4-positive T-helper cells (P = .002) and specifically T-helper 1 (P = .004) were shown to be highly discriminatory to predict early transformation. A role for functional modulation of follicular dendritic cells could also be supported (P = .04). Other cell populations, including CD68-positive macrophages and regulatory T cells, were not differentially present. CONCLUSION These results support the identification of FL as an immunologically functional disease in which an interaction of the tumor cells and the functional composition of the microenvironment determines the clinical behavior.},

abstract = {Rapid progress in the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in recent years has provided many valuable insights into complex biological systems, ranging from cancer genomics to diverse microbial communities. NGS-based technologies for genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics are now increasingly focused on the characterization of individual cells. These single-cell analyses will allow researchers to uncover new and potentially unexpected biological discoveries relative to traditional profiling methods that assess bulk populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for example, can reveal complex and rare cell populations, uncover regulatory relationships between genes, and track the trajectories of distinct cell lineages in development. In this review, we will focus on technical challenges in single-cell isolation and library preparation and on computational analysis pipelines available for analyzing scRNA-seq data. Further technical improvements at the level of molecular and cell biology and in available bioinformatics tools will greatly facilitate both the basic science and medical applications of these sequencing technologies.},

abstract = {Ki-67 is a nuclear protein involved in cell proliferation regulation, and its expression has been widely used as an index to evaluate the proliferative activity of lymphoma. However, its prognostic value for lymphoma is still contradictory and inconclusive. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched with identical strategies. The impact of Ki-67 expression on survival with lymphoma and various subtypes of lymphoma was evaluated. The relationship between Ki-67 expression and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) was also investigated after the introduction of a CD-20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. Furthermore, we evaluated the association between Ki-67 expression and the clinical-pathological features of lymphoma. A total of 27 studies met the inclusion criteria, which comprised 3902 patients. Meta-analysis suggested that high Ki-67 expression was negatively associated with disease free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.727, 95{\%} CI: 1.159-2.571) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.7, 95{\%} CI: 1.44-2) for lymphoma patients. Subgroup analysis on the different subtypes of lymphoma suggested that the association between high Ki-67 expression and OS in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HR = 1.511, 95{\%} CI: 0.524-4.358) was absent, while high Ki-67 expression was highly associated with worse OS for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (HR = 1.777, 95{\%} CI: 1.463-2.159) and its various subtypes, including NK/T lymphoma (HR = 4.766, 95{\%} CI: 1.917-11.849), DLBCL (HR = 1.457, 95{\%} CI: 1.123-1.891) and MCL (HR = 2.48, 95{\%} CI: 1.61-3.81). Furthermore, the pooled HRs for MCL was 1.981 (95{\%} CI: 1.099-3.569) with rituximab and 3.123 (95{\%} CI: 2.049-4.76) without rituximab, while for DLBCL, the combined HRs for DLBCL with and without rituximab was 1.459 (95{\%} CI: 1.084-2.062) and 1.456 (95{\%} CI: 0.951-2.23) respectively. In addition, there was no correlation between high Ki-67 expression and the clinical-pathological features of lymphoma including the LDH level, B symptoms, tumor stage, extranodal site, performance status and IPI score. This study showed that the prognostic significance of Ki-67 expression varied in different subtypes of lymphoma and in DLBCL and MCL after the introduction of rituximab, which was valuable for clinical decision-making and individual prognostic evaluation.},

Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is incurable with conventional therapies and has a clinical course typified by multiple relapses after therapy. These tumors are genetically characterized by B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) translocation and mutation of genes involved in chromatin modification. By analyzing purified tumor cells, we identified additional novel recurrently mutated genes and confirmed mutations of one or more chromatin modifier genes within 96{\%} of FL tumors and two or more in 76{\%} of tumors. We defined the hierarchy of somatic mutations arising during tumor evolution by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship of somatic mutations across the coding genomes of 59 sequentially acquired biopsies from 22 patients. Among all somatically mutated genes, CREBBP mutations were most significantly enriched within the earliest inferable progenitor. These mutations were associated with a signature of decreased antigen presentation characterized by reduced transcript and protein abundance of MHC class II on tumor B cells, in line with the role of CREBBP in promoting class II transactivator (CIITA)-dependent transcriptional activation of these genes. CREBBP mutant B cells stimulated less proliferation of T cells in vitro compared with wild-type B cells from the same tumor. Transcriptional signatures of tumor-infiltrating T cells were indicative of reduced proliferation, and this corresponded to decreased frequencies of tumor-infiltrating CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory cytotoxic T cells. These observations therefore implicate CREBBP mutation as an early event in FL evolution that contributes to immune evasion via decreased antigen presentation.},

Here, we have used an unbiased, systematic approach to examine the effects of 1,849 cytokine combinations on virus-specific CD8 + T-cell activation. This study identifies several unexpected cytokine combinations that synergize to induce antigen-independent IFN$\gamma$ production and CD69 up-regulation by CD8 + T cells in addition to cytokines that exhibit differential regulatory functions, with the ability to either enhance or inhibit T-cell IFN$\gamma$ production, depending on which cytokine partner is present.

abstract = {Little is known about the expression of bcl-2 protein in intermediate and high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and its clinical and prognostic significance. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of bcl-2 expression in tumoral tissue sections of 348 patients with high or intermediate grade NHL. These patients were uniformly treated with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisone (ACVBP) in the induction phase of the LNH87 protocol. Fifty eight cases were excluded due to inadequate staining. Of the 290 remaining patients, 131 (45{\%}) disclosed homogeneous positivity (high bcl-2 expression) in virtually all tumor cells, whereas 65 (23{\%}) were negative and 94 (32{\%}) exhibited intermediate staining. High bcl-2 expression was more frequent in B-cell NHL (109 of 214, 51{\%}) than in T-cell NHL (6 of 35, 17{\%}) (P = .0004), and was heterogeneously distributed among the different histological subtypes. Further analysis was performed on the 151 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (centroblastic and immunoblastic) to assess the clinical significance and potential prognostic value of bcl-2 expression in the most frequent and homogeneous immunohistological subgroup. High bcl-2 expression, found in 44{\%} of these patients (67 of 151), was more frequently associated with III-IV stage disease (P = .002). Reduced disease-free survival (DFS) (P {\textless} .01) and overall survival (P {\textless} .05) were demonstrated in the patients with high bcl-2 expression. Indeed, the 3-year estimates of DFS and overall survival were 60{\%} and 61{\%}, respectively (high bcl-2 expression) versus 82{\%} and 78{\%}, respectively (negative/intermediate bcl-2 expression). A multivariate regression analysis confirmed the independent effect of bcl-2 protein expression on DFS. Thus bcl-2 protein expression, as demonstrated in routinely paraffin-embedded tissue, appears to be predictive of poor DFS, in agreement with the role of bcl-2 in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. It might be considered as a new independent biologic prognostic parameter, which, especially in diffuse large B-cell NHL, could aid in the identification of patient risk groups.},

abstract = {Although the BCL6 transcriptional repressor is frequently expressed in human follicular lymphomas (FL), its biological role in this disease remains unknown. Herein, we comprehensively identify the set of gene promoters directly targeted by BCL6 in primary human FLs. We noted that BCL6 binds and represses NOTCH2 and NOTCH pathway genes. Moreover, BCL6 and NOTCH2 pathway gene expression is inversely correlated in FL. Notably, BCL6 upregulation is associated with repression of NOTCH2 and its target genes in primary human and murine germinal center (GC) cells. Repression of NOTCH2 is an essential function of BCL6 in FL and GC B cells because inducible expression of Notch2 abrogated GC formation in mice and killed FL cells. Indeed, BCL6-targeting compounds or gene silencing leads to the induction of NOTCH2 activity and compromises survival of FL cells, whereas NOTCH2 depletion or pathway antagonists rescue FL cells from such effects. Moreover, BCL6 inhibitors induced NOTCH2 expression and suppressed growth of human FL xenografts in vivo and primary human FL specimens ex vivo These studies suggest that established FLs are thus dependent on BCL6 through its suppression of NOTCH2Significance: We show that human FLs are dependent on BCL6, and primary human FLs can be killed using specific BCL6 inhibitors. Integrative genomics and functional studies of BCL6 in primary FL cells point toward a novel mechanism whereby BCL6 repression of NOTCH2 drives the survival and growth of FL cells as well as GC B cells, which are the FL cell of origin.

The actions of BCL6 in B cells involve formation of distinct chromatin modifying complexes that silence specific promoter and enhancer networks, respectively. The same biochemical mechanisms are maintained in malignant lymphoma cells. Targeted inhibition of these BCL6 functions has emerged as the basis for rational design of lymphoma therapies and combinatorial regimens.

Greater insight into the nature of the CD4+ T cells involved in this process was provided by two studies in 2000 that described CD4+ T cells residing in the B cell follicle that expressed CXCR5. As a result these cells were named follicular B helper T cells, now more commonly known as T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Since then there has been enormous growth in our understanding of these cells, now considered a distinct T helper (Th) cell lineage that can arise from naive CD4+ T cells following activation.

abstract = {MOTIVATION Many biological data processing problems can be formalized as clustering problems to partition data points into sensible and biologically interpretable groups. RESULTS This article introduces densityCut, a novel density-based clustering algorithm, which is both time- and space-efficient and proceeds as follows: densityCut first roughly estimates the densities of data points from a K-nearest neighbour graph and then refines the densities via a random walk. A cluster consists of points falling into the basin of attraction of an estimated mode of the underlining density function. A post-processing step merges clusters and generates a hierarchical cluster tree. The number of clusters is selected from the most stable clustering in the hierarchical cluster tree. Experimental results on ten synthetic benchmark datasets and two microarray gene expression datasets demonstrate that densityCut performs better than state-of-the-art algorithms for clustering biological datasets. For applications, we focus on the recent cancer mutation clustering and single cell data analyses, namely to cluster variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations to reveal clonal architectures of individual tumours, to cluster single-cell gene expression data to uncover cell population compositions, and to cluster single-cell mass cytometry data to detect communities of cells of the same functional states or types. densityCut performs better than competing algorithms and is scalable to large datasets.

@article{Levine2015,
abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) manifests as phenotypically and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient. Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into AML pathophysiology.},

@article{Kridel2016,
abstract = {Background Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, yet incurable B cell malignancy. A subset of patients experience an increased mortality rate driven by two distinct clinical end points: histological transformation and early progression after immunochemotherapy. The nature of tumor clonal dynamics leading to these clinical end points is poorly understood, and previously determined genetic alterations do not explain the majority of transformed cases or accurately predict early progressive disease. We contend that detailed knowledge of the expansion patterns of specific cell populations plus their associated mutations would provide insight into therapeutic strategies and disease biology over the time course of FL clinical histories.   Methods and Findings Using a combination of whole genome sequencing, targeted deep sequencing, and digital droplet PCR on matched diagnostic and relapse specimens, we deciphered the constituent clonal populations in 15 transformation cases and 6 progression cases, and measured the change in clonal population abundance over time. We observed widely divergent patterns of clonal dynamics in transformed cases relative to progressed cases. Transformation specimens were generally composed of clones that were rare or absent in diagnostic specimens, consistent with dramatic clonal expansions that came to dominate the transformation specimens. This pattern was independent of time to transformation and treatment modality. By contrast, early progression specimens were composed of clones that were already present in the diagnostic specimens and exhibited only moderate clonal dynamics, even in the presence of immunochemotherapy. Analysis of somatic mutations impacting 94 genes was undertaken in an extension cohort consisting of 395 samples from 277 patients in order to decipher disrupted biology in the two clinical end points. We found 12 genes that were more commonly mutated in transformed samples than in the preceding FL tumors, including TP53, B2M, CCND3, GNA13, S1PR2, and P2RY8. Moreover, ten genes were more commonly mutated in diagnostic specimens of patients with early progression, including TP53, BTG1, MKI67, and XBP1.   Conclusions Our results illuminate contrasting modes of evolution shaping the clinical histories of transformation and progression. They have implications for interpretation of evolutionary dynamics in the context of treatment-induced selective pressures, and indicate that transformation and progression will require different clinical management strategies.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing has great potential to discover cell types, identify cell states, trace development lineages, and reconstruct the spatial organization of cells. However, dimension reduction to interpret structure in single-cell sequencing data remains a challenge. Existing algorithms are either not able to uncover the clustering structures in the data or lose global information such as groups of clusters that are close to each other. We present a robust statistical model, scvis, to capture and visualize the low-dimensional structures in single-cell gene expression data. Simulation results demonstrate that low-dimensional representations learned by scvis preserve both the local and global neighbor structures in the data. In addition, scvis is robust to the number of data points and learns a probabilistic parametric mapping function to add new data points to an existing embedding. We then use scvis to analyze four single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, exemplifying interpretable two-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to profile the transcriptome of individual cells. This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk RNA sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This will provide a range of usage scenarios from which readers can construct their own analysis pipelines.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set.
